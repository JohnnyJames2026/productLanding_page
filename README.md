The purpose of this program is to create a fake product landing page for clothing. This project is a practice project coming from freeCodeCamp's web development course over responsive web design. I will be practicing certain elements from HTML/CSS in this project to prove how much I have learned, but also to practice and get better. The page will be a simple, single page website which contains a navbar for cycling through options such as prices and product lists. I will make a fake company, which will be the seller, and my aim is to make this as realistic as possible without overextending the scope of the project.
